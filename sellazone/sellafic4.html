			”J-Just… Let me know if I’m going too rough…” Bella nervously muttered, her soft tone contrasting heavily with the way she ravenously tasted and bit on the other girl’s skin. In all the excitement, she’d accidentally pricked her with those sharp teeth a few times, causing a spew of apologies until Sid had told her to shut up and keep going. Bella obliged, reluctantly at first, but it didn’t take too long for her desires to start dulling her inhibitions once more. Sid watched the Nosferatu, just barely able to stop herself from going completely feral over her body. It was partially amusing, and heavily tantalizing.

However, despite her excitement, Isabelle still needed to be led along somewhat. She apparently still hadn’t conceived of the idea of moving her focus to any other part of Sid’s body, and as admittedly enjoyable as this was, the Malkavian needed more. The hand that was still half-petting, half-pulling on Bella’s hair instead moved down to grab at one of her bony wrists. She guided it down along her smooth, pale form, making Isabelle scratch lightly at her skin with her pink-painted fingernails. The hand travelled further and further down, finally coming to rest on her inner thigh. Sid firmly pushed her hand down, making it extra clear what she wanted from the other girl next. Bella had no objections, and as soon as Sid released her wrist she began to curiously explore without any of the same hesitation she’d had prior. Her hand squeezed and rubbed at the plush, soft thigh in a way that was eager, but remained gentle, snaking her fingers between Sid’s legs to rub at her inner thighs, just below the radiating heat of her arousal.

“I don’t know what’s gotten in to you, Bella…” Sid muttered through gritted teeth and pleasured grunts, bringing the Nosferatu’s head in close to her own to speak in a harsh, breathy tone right in to her ear, <i>“...But you better not fucking stop.”</i>

Hearing that demanding whisper as Sid clutched so tightly on to her caused Isabelle to shake with excitement, with the only response she could muster being a needy little whimper of agreement. Bella shifted her head slightly, allowing her to start leaving a trail of hungry kisses from Sid’s cheek down to her neck, the desperation with which she did so showing just how bad her desire to show her affection was getting. Her hand moved up underneath Sid’s black skirt, lingering for just a moment, before testing the waters by gently grazing her fingers over the soaked fabric of her underwear. Feeling just how damp it was down there brought another wave of vibrant titillation to the Nosferatu, which she expressed in the first manner that came to her scrambled mind — biting down on Sid’s shoulder. She didn’t do so with too much force, but it was hard enough to bring a sharp gasp from the Malkavian. For a brief moment, Bella worried once more that she’d gone too far. However, as she watched the girl beneath her shiver with excitement, and felt her jamming her legs together and trapping Bella’s hand in between, her nerves lifted some, as she relaxed her jaws and followed up with a sprinkling of soft kisses along the visible teeth marks.

As the tension in Sid’s upper legs finally released and let Isabelle’s hand free, she’d finally begin giving the girl the release she’d been waiting for. She pressed her fingers firmly against the wettest spot of fabric and began to work them up and down. It started at a slow, slightly unsure pace, but as soon as she received positive feedback from Sid in the form of gentle whines of pleasure, her movements quickly began to pick up speed. Every time one of those sweet sounds slipped from the Malkavian, Bella was spurred to work harder and harder in hopes of hearing more and more of them.

Sid felt the pleasure rising within her surprisingly quickly, far quicker than she was used to. She put her arms around the other girl, grabbing a handful of fabric from the back of her shirt and clutching on to it tightly, as her other hand forced her head down towards herself, as though urging her to put that surprisingly skilled mouth to use once again. Bella didn’t need any more of an excuse than that, immediately beginning to greedily lick and kiss her once more. Her tongue dragged itself over the same places it had before — her nipples, collarbone and neck — but soon Bella’s curiosity began to take her elsewhere, wanting to taste more of her. Her tongue happily explored the nearby skin that hadn’t already been coated in her saliva, making even more of a mess of Sid in the process. With no clear direction in mind, she trailed over to her shoulder, and then along her upper arm, before finally ending up just underneath it. With a little nudge of her head, she was able to get Sid to lift her arm just enough to allow Bella to plant a soft kiss on her armpit.

Even in the throes of passion and pleasure, this caught Sid’s attention pretty fast, and only threw her off even more when the Nosferatu began to focus all of her attention on the area. Her tongue lapped away at her underarm with increased excitement, causing Sid a slew of mixed feelings that she didn’t have the mental capacity spare to sort through in this moment — not with her climax creeping closer with every second. She reached up to tightly grab a handful of Bella’s hair, but her body found itself unable to decide whether to pull her away from the spot or push her further in.

“B..Bella.. What the fuck are you- <i>AH!”</i> Sid’s questioning was countered before she could even get it out by an increased rubbing at her desperate, swollen crotch. The fabric of her underwear had gotten so soaked now that Bella’s fingers could glide over them as if they weren’t there in the first place, leading to a deceptively intense sensation for having no direct contact. The Malkavian was almost embarrassed that she was this far along to an orgasm without even getting her knickers off, not to mention the fact that they were going to be totally ruined after this. All of that, along with the fact that Sid seemed unable to stop Bella from practically making out with her armpit, gave her the realisation that she’d rather quickly lost her control over this situation entirely. This inexperienced, virgin nozzie was asserting full dominance over her — and what’s worse, she was doing it without even meaning to. Isabelle was driven almost purely by a desire to please Sid, and she was managing to do so much better than could have been expected. As for the fixation on her axilla, that seemed to be her indulging in some of her own curiosities while she had the chance.

Eventually, Sid was forced to admit defeat, her body starting to tense and tremble as Bella’s clumsy-yet-effective fingers brought her closer and closer to her peak. Her body was too impatient to wait much longer, roughly grinding her hips against Isabelle’s fingers in an attempt to speed up the process. Lucky for her, the Nosferatu had no desire to tease or withhold the orgasm from her, and seeming to pick up on the increased urgency in her body language, she’d push her fingers firmly into the wet fabric and begin to rub at her as feverishly as she could manage. The pleasure radiated across her whole body, causing every movement and shift in position to send tingles running throughout her —  even the soft, ticklish sensation of Bella’s tongue against her armpit became notably stimulating. An unbroken stream of huffs, whines and moans spilled from Sid’s open mouth, her back arching and her clutches on the other girl tightening until finally, she felt herself go over the edge.


<i>“Fuck,</i> Bella!” She gasped, shoving her hips roughly up against Isabelle’s fingers and bringing her into a close embrace. The Nosferatu’s head was jammed underneath Sid’s arm, causing a shiver to run through her that almost rivalled the Malkavian’s intense trembling. As Sid rode out the waves of ecstatic sensation her body rhythmically tensed and relaxed, and any thoughts that had been running through her head previously were forced to take a backseat to pure desire and satisfaction Isabelle had sparked up in her. This didn’t cease until her climax finally began to die down, slowly ramping down until it had become a light electric buzz that still gently coursed through her, allowing her access to her mental faculties once again.

As she huffed and panted — not out of any real need to catch her breath, but simply out of an old habit from her days as a mortal — it took her several more moments to finally find her voice again, her grip on the other girl slowly loosening as she looked down to her and spoke.

“..R..Really, Bella? My <i>armpit?”</i> She addressed her with clear judgement. Isabelle, who had been much too focused to say much of anything until now, offered a nervous giggle that seemed to imply shame, though the dumb grin on her face showed much the opposite.

“Sorry! I just-”

“It’s fine, Bella. Nevermind.” Sid interrupted tersely and swiftly, realising that every moment spent dwelling on this was a moment she’d have to consider just how much she’d enjoyed that perverse little act.

Isabelle slowly withdrew her hand from the loose grip Sid’s thighs still had on it, her fingers still damp with Sid’s gliss. Unable to help herself, Bella lifted the hand up towards her face and curiously tested it with her tongue — enough to draw an exasperated sigh from Sid as she watched it happen.

“Gross, Bella.”
