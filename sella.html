<b>Chapter 1</b>

“What do you mean, ‘don’t come back’? Oh, go for a walk in the sun, dickhead!”

Sid jammed her finger against the ‘end call’ button on her phone, before turning around and throwing it hard against the wall. Even after all this time, it was easy to forget her vampiric strength in moments of impulsive anger. It struck against the wall, splintering off some wallpaper and even making a chip in the brick. The phone itself was fine, only suffering another scuff across the edge of its housing. “Thing’s fucking invincible.” She muttered to herself as she took a few steps across the room to reach down and pick it up again.

“..Everything okay?” The voice came from thin air, not even a metre to her left. Sid tensed up and jumped back in surprise with a wide-eyed glare at the direction of the sound. Isabelle’s lanky form slowly rematerialised in front of her as she removed her obfuscation. She looked visibly shaken, likely from having a Nokia thrown at dangerous speeds right in her direction. After a few blinks and shakes of her head to get the blurry image of the girl before her to fully appear, Sid’s glare narrowed as she prepared for another outburst.

“What the FUCK, Bella?!” She snapped, clenching her fists as the Nosferatu recoiled slightly.

“Sorry, sorry!” Bella apologised, her voice struck with an anxious tone. “I didn’t mean to eavesdrop!”

“Then why the fuck are you still in here?!”

“It’s just-! You were stood in front of the door…” She meekly pointed one of her bony fingers up to the only door in the small office — the same one that Sid had been leaning on for most of that heated phone conversation. “I would have said something, but… I think you forgot I was in here… And then it felt really awkward to interrupt you, and..” Her voice slowly trailed off, as she remained stood in the corner of the room and rubbed at her elbow. Sid took a few moments to consider her response, deciding whether or not it was worth continuing her fit of anger over. Eventually, she let out an exasperated groan, slowly releasing the tension in her body before taking a step and sitting down on the desk just next to her. There was never much point in remaining angry at this wet tissue of a vampire. 

She reached into her pocket and withdrew a cigarette, along with her lighter. Just like any other kindred, she had to be extra careful with the flame as she lit it, but over the handful of years since she’d crossed over to the side of the undead, she’d gotten pretty used to it. With a prolonged inhale, her dead lungs were forced in to action once more, taking in the smoke and pushing it out again soon after. Nicotine didn’t have much of an effect on kindred, but smoking remained a relaxing ritual for many regardless, especially those who were smokers in their mortal lifetimes.

“Well? Go on, then. The door’s clear.” Sid spoke, expecting Isabelle to make herself sparse. But instead, she was met with another awkward silence, eventually forcing her to turn around and glare back at her, raising her eyebrow impatiently. “What?”

Bella was still stood in the same place, slightly hunched over, and anxiously rubbing her palms together. It was obvious from a glance that if kindred could sweat, the Nosferatu would be soaking.
“Do you… Need somewhere to stay?”

“What’re you talking about, Bella?” Sid replied.

“I.. I mean, I heard you talking. They told you not to go back, right? So… Do you have anywhere to go? You could stay with me… If you want.” She pushed the words out, trying and failing to keep her cool.

Sid wouldn’t have struggled too hard to find a place to crash for the night. She knew of dens all over the city, full of people who’d be glad to accept her  — or at least be too afraid of the consequences of turning her down. It wouldn’t have been the safest or most comfortable place to sleep the day away, but neither was her old place.

“Tch, please. I’d rather spend a night in a crack den than a sewer, nozzie.” She spoke dismissively, turning away once again and taking another hit from her cigarette, “Least I could probably score some more heroin there.”

“No, no! I don’t live in the sewer!” Bella was quick to interject, seeming to gain a sudden increase in confidence. “We live in an old anti-aircraft operations building! We needed somewhere with some more privacy, so it’s like, super secret!” She seemed almost proud of herself, grinning in a way that let the dim office light glint off those freakishly sharp teeth, big even for a kindred. Sid had seen the way she used those to feed, and it wasn’t pretty. “It’s a super nice place, promise!”

Surprisingly, Sid actually found herself considering it. The recent jobs they’d been working had required her to stir up some of the surrounding gangs, and apparently they hadn’t been taking too kindly to it. That’s the whole reason she’d been kicked out in the first place, and it probably meant that finding a safe spot that wouldn’t turn her down would be harder than usual. And she had to admit, she was curious — what kind of place did a Nosferatu consider ‘super nice’?

The night was still fairly young. They’d only been called over today for a debrief of sorts, and their big mission to rescue Edward wasn’t going to be ready for another couple nights. Sid supposed that she could at least check the place out, and she’d still have time to ditch and find a new spot if it was a complete shithole. And so, with a groan and a roll of her eyes, Sid would stub out her cigarette and stand back up.

“Fine, Isabelle. Lead the way.”



Isabelle happily hummed a tune to herself as she effortlessly made her way across the narrow dirt path, slipping past the sharp branches that jutted out from the shrubbery as if they weren’t even there. Sid, on the other hand, was having a far less pleasant time. She’d already accrued a number of nicks and scratches across her clothes and skin, and her now messy hair had caught a few dead leaves. She was already regretting her decision to follow along, and this feeling only increased when they finally reached the clearing and could see the building before them. It was an ugly, brutalist eyesore in the shape of a giant concrete slab, covered in crude graffiti and overgrown with moss and vine. She could see how a nozzie would feel right at home here. 
Bella seemed to be in one of her hyperactive moods again, shifting back and forth on the spot as she turned around and lifted her arms with a grin on her face, “Ta-daaa! See, that wasn’t so bad!”
“Speak for yourself, Bella.” Sid replied, her voice terse and unimpressed.
Upon seeing the state she was in, Isabelle’s expression dropped and she immediately began to apologise. “Oh! Sorry, sorry!” She reached her hand over, attempting to brush the leaves out of her hair. The moment her finger made contact, Sid’s hand shot up to grab harshly onto her wrist, causing the Nosferatu to recoil and pull back. “Sorrysorrysorrysorry-”
“It’s fine. Let’s just get inside.” Sid spoke, slowly letting go of Bella’s arm. She hadn’t meant to snap at her like that, but she didn’t feel bad enough to apologise for it. The Nosferatu had returned to her usual awkward, hunched demeanour as she quietly began walking her over to the building. The main entrance had been welded shut, meaning that the only half-convenient way to get in and out was through a small stairway around the back that led into a small tunnel, just barely tall enough for Bella to stand up straight in.
“Bella, I thought you said this place was super nice.” Sid spoke up, sounding like she would have been disappointed if she had actually believed the claim in the first place.
“Just wait! Trust me!” The other girl insisted, leading her along the tunnel until they reached another metal door. She rapped her knuckles against it in a particular rhythm, calling out with a playful “I’m hooooome!” as she waited for an answer. It wasn’t too long before the heavy door was pushed open, making a terrible creaking sound as it was. Stood on the other side was another kindred — a stout bodied man with a pair of thick rimmed glasses and a receding hairline. While his clothes had some of the usual dirt and disrepair seen with many Nosferatu, it seemed he had made an effort to keep his attire as smart as possible, with his blue-plaid shirt kept fairly clean and tear-free, and tucked neatly into his black trousers.
“Ah, Isabelle, you’re home early tonight.” The man welcomed her, his voice deep and gruff, but not too unpleasant, especially for his clan. He adjusted his glasses as he looked past her and in Sid’s direction, furrowing his brow ever so slightly, “...And you’ve brought a guest.” His tone expressed a desire for an explanation, and Isabelle was quick to jump in.
“Oh, don’t worry! This is Sid!” She beamed, stepping aside a little to bring her in to view. Sid briefly lifted a hand out of the pocket of her coat to give a small, customary wave, but didn’t seem in the mood for striking up conversation. Regardless, Bella’s words seemed to work well enough, as his expression softened somewhat once again and he gave a single nod of greeting to the Malkavian.
“Oh? It’s nice to meet you, Sid — my name is Albert Clarkson. Isabelle has told me much about you.” He addressed her, before curiously adding, “What brings you here tonight?”
Sid was hoping to be able to escape this interaction without having to speak with anyone, but it seemed as though she wouldn’t be so lucky.
“Bella offered to let me crash here for the day. Home problems.” She dismissively answered, her tone expressing her lack of interest in conversation.
“I see.” Albert took note of the somewhat abrasive answer, but didn’t bother to push on it, “Well, you’re welcome for as long as you like. I trust Isabelle has expressed the importance of keeping our presence here a secret?”
Isabelle was quick to jump in once again, taking over for Sid, “She’s not gonna tell anyone! I told her it was super secret.”
Seemingly satisfied with this, Albert stepped aside to allow them in. After a few more moments of chat between him and Isabelle, the two were finally free to explore the run-down building. Much to Sid’s surprise, it actually wasn’t too bad.
Of course, it was still a bit of a shithole. The cold, concrete walls were still just as ugly on the inside, with the only colour in the room coming from the low-effort, mostly explicit graffiti plastered across them. But whereas the outside was unkept and messy with trash, the inside had been tidied up rather thoroughly. The floors were clear of debris and even seemed to be dusted regularly. There was some actual furniture that was at least mostly clean put around the place, and the halls and rooms had been fixed with fairy lights and lamps to keep everything nice and see-able. Sid hadn’t actually been to any Nosferatu communities before, so she had no idea if this was out of the ordinary for them, but it was certainly a little nicer than the trash-heap she was expecting. Hell, she’d been to a fair share of drug dens that were worse than this.
As Bella led her through the slightly cramped halls, they’d walk past a few other members of the brood. It was an odd bunch, but that was pretty in-line with the clan. They varied in age and appearance, although many of them seemed to be harmless-looking enough. Bella had mentioned that they were working on some kind of online network project here, and many of the Nosferatu living here appeared fittingly nerdy for such a job. There was an impressive amount of computers, server racks and other tech set up in a few of the rooms, most of which was too complex for Sid to even begin to understand.
“Alright, I’ll hand it to you, Bella. It’s not the most disgusting place I’ve ever seen.” She stated, her attitude having relaxed a little now that she’d confirmed she wouldn’t be using a pile of trash as a mattress tonight.
“See, I told you so! Just wait until you see my room!” Isabelle had perked up quite a bit as well, and there was a barely contained excitement in her step and in her voice as she pushed open a door and entered one of the rooms, urging Sid to follow along.
The moment Sid turned the corner, it was immediately clear that she was in Isabelle’s room. It was a mess of so many colours and items that her brain had no idea where to look first. The walls were covered in so many posters and decorations that you could hardly even tell they were made of concrete. Her bedsheets had a zebra-print pattern, and the bed itself was covered in large number of plush toys. On her desk was a drawing tablet, a few sketchbooks and a few pots of unsorted pens, pencils and other stationery. Sat next to the desk was a cardboard box, full to the brim with a mess of tangled cables that she needed for god knows what.
Sid couldn’t help but smirk a little as she took it all in. “Yeah, this is pretty much exactly what I imagined your room would look like.”
Isabelle had moved to take a seat on her mattress, sitting with her legs crossed and offering Sid a large, fanged grin, “I’ll take that as a compliment, I guess! Uh, feel free to look around!”
The Malkavian took a few seconds to do so, slowly adjusting her eyes to the neon nightmare before her. It was kind of charming, in its own, very Bella-y way. She took a few steps, stopping to examine the posters on the wall. Lots of band posters, mostly emo stuff, some electronic, with a few curveballs thrown in. She would’ve made a better assessment of her music taste, but she was getting too distracted by all of the little hearts drawn in with marker around the lead singer of Paramore’s face. Choosing to just move past that, she’d also see some cartoon posters thrown in the mix — if she counted the multiple Invader Zim posters, and then added the amount of stickers stuck to random things, it was by far the most times she’d ever seen GIR in one room.
“...You ever read Johnny the Homicidal Maniac?” Sid asked, looking back at Bella for a moment, who would eagerly nod in response.
“Duh! Hold on, wait! I’ve got a few of the issues here!” The Nosferatu reached under her bed and pulled out a box of comic books, somewhat clumsily sifting through them until she found what she was looking for. She gestured for Sid to come over, shifting to the side to allow her some room to sit on the bed next to her. “Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, Issue 1!” She proudly exclaimed, handing the thin book over to her.
“Wow, I haven’t read this in ages. Pretty sweet, actually.” Sid was impressed, giving Bella a light nudge with her elbow as she spoke. She lifted her legs up onto the mattress, crossing them, and allowing herself to get a little more comfortable on it as she started to lightly skim through the issue. After a moment, she felt Bella tapping on her shoulder. She looked to her side, to see the girl holding up a purple hairbrush.
“...Can I?” She asked, her voice becoming a little more meek once again as she pointed up at the girl’s hair, still tangled and dirtied.
Sid seemed hesitant. Her unsure glance shifted between Bella and the brush a few times, as the other silently awaited an answer. There was a somewhat odd expression on Sid’s face, one that Bella wasn’t sure she’d seen from her before. It took a few more moments of silence for her to finally make up her mind, giving a light sigh before speaking up.
“Fiine, go on, then. But don’t fuck with it.” She warned, turning herself a little to face away from Isabelle. She didn’t even need to be looking at Bella to sense that gleeful excitement, as the Nosferatu shifted around to a better sitting position just behind her. She lifted the brush and slowly began to drag it through her hair. She first made sure to get rid of the couple leaves and small twigs that had managed to stay in there, before beginning on working out the tangles. For someone so hyperactive, she was surprisingly careful here, slowly letting the hair untangle itself around the brushes bristles, and not forcing or tugging on it at all. Her bony hands were cold, devoid of any of the life found in a mortal’s — and yet, there was a certain warmth in them, that flickered up and brought a subtle, mellow heat gently across her whole body. As she became more comfortable with the situation, Sid would lean back a little further, allowing Bella to take some of her weight as she silently read through the pages of the comic in her hands.

<b>Chapter 2</b>

Sid, with her hair newly brushed, was now sat with her legs crossed on the mattress. She watching the Nosferatu’s laptop screen with only mild interest. Bella was rambling on, and Sid had already zoned in and out multiple times during her long-winded explanation.

“...So then, once you’ve got the torrent file, it gets the client to connect to other users, so everyone who’s got the full thing can send you a little bit at a time instead of you having to download the whole thing at once, which is like, way slower! Because most people have way higher download speeds than upload speeds… And also, if any part of the file gets broken, then its way easier to-”

“Bella.” Sid interjected, finally getting tired of the constant stream of hyperactive droning in her ear. “...Is the movie done downloading yet, or what?”

“Oh! Uhh, yeah, it finished… 5 minutes ago.” Bella replied in a sheepish tone, only now realising how long she’d been talking for. Without needing to be told, she’d click over to the movie, a relatively new horror release titled ‘One Missed Call’, and let it play.

…

“Well, that fucking sucked.” Sid was the first to speak up after the credits began to roll. During the hour and a half runtime of the movie, both of them had shifted to comfier positions. Sid was currently laying on her front, propping her head up on her elbows and lightly kicking her legs up behind her. Bella, on the other hand, was sprawled out on her side, twisting her torso in an awkward manner that Sid refused to believe could be remotely comfortable.

“Oh, c’mon! It wasn’t too bad! I liked the part where… Uh…” Bella trailed off, failing to conjure up any reasonable defence for the flick.

“Bella, I enjoy some pretty shit horror movies, but even I have my limits. This was it.”

“Fiiiine. Maybe you’re right.” The Nosferatu conceded as she closed the player, before laying back on her side, now looking up at Sid with a fanged grin on her face. “So, what do you wanna do now?”

“Get high.”

“Oh! Uhh… I don’t think we have any drugs around here. Or people to drink them from.”

The Malkavian rolled her eyes, looking back down at the other girl, “I know, Bella. Just fantasizing. I’m too broke to afford much right now, anyway.”

“Already? You got paid 5 grand, like, a week ago!”

Another eyeroll. “Yeah. And I buy a lot of drugs, and owe a lot of people money.”

“Sheesh, Sid!” Bella frowned, giving her a look that conveyed a mix of sympathy and confusion. She wasn’t able to comprehend the string of events that would lead someone to living a life like Sid’s. Nor did she have the context to understand just how tragic it was. Sid simply shrugged and looked off to the side.

An awkward silence filled the room for the next few moments, the only sound coming from the light tapping of Bella’s fingers against the mattress.

“Well, I hope you get paid some more soon!” Isabelle broke the silence, accompanying her words with a dumb, optimistic smile, before she reeled herself back in for a moment to add, “...But, maybe don’t spend it all on… Drugs. And stuff.”

Sid looked silently back down at Bella for a second or two, raising her eyebrow, “...That’s your advice? ‘Don’t spend it all on drugs and stuff’?” The Malkavian stared for a few more moments, before she broke, unable to stop herself from snickering. “You know what, Bella? I’ll keep it in mind.”

Bella didn’t quite understand what about that was so funny, but seeing Sid break into a smile over it made her glad that it was. A grin stretched across her lips, and she immediately jolted up in to a sitting position. “So you do smile!” She was failing pretty hard at containing her excitement. The reaction took Sid a little off guard, and for a moment she had the look of a kid who’d just been caught doing something they shouldn’t. Quickly, she’d clear her throat and regain her composure, rolling her eyes at Isabelle once more.

“Yes, Bella, well done. I am indeed capable of smiling.” She mocked, attempting to play it off as best as possible while Bella sat there giggling and excitedly shifting around on the spot.

“Do it again! C’mon!” She urged, leaning in closer, and reaching out to playfully poke at Sid’s shoulder. Sid was quick to swat the hand away, but that only caused her to try again. And then again, and a few more times after that, until Sid was all but forced into a catfight with her.

“Piss off, Bella!” The Malkavian warned, trying her best to sound serious, but she couldn’t stop her tone from betraying her amusement. She’d shifted up in to a sitting position, freeing up both arms to keep the Nosferatu at bay. Isabelle was grinning ear to ear now, continuing her onslaught of pestering.

“Nuh-uh! Not until you smile again!” She urged, poking up at the girl’s pale cheeks. It was getting harder and harder to effectively repel this attack, but it wouldn’t matter regardless, as Sid finally cracked once again. Her lips curled into a smile, and a giggle would slip from them before she could catch it. This look seemed unusual on Sid’s usually broody face, and yet in this moment, it seemed to come so naturally to her.

“Okay, okay! Now piss off! I mean it!” Sid spoke out through her chuckles. As promised, Isabelle’s prodding slowed to a halt, and the two spent a moment enjoying the fleeting fit of laughter together before it too began to quiet down. Bella was still leaned in quite close, easily close enough to be considered within Sid’s personal bubble, and the Nosferatu was still staring at her with a silly look on her face.

“...You’re cute when you smile, Sid.” She spoke, her usual loud, shrieky tone having notably softened. She was giving the Malkavian a dreamy look, and if their kind had any need to respire, she’d almost certainly be breathing heavily down her neck.

Likewise, if their kind had any need for blood circulation, both their faces would have been going red by now. The rush of excitement was quickly beginning to die down, leaving Bella with a creeping nervousness building up within her. Perhaps that spur of the moment comment was too much? Sid was still processing it, trying in vain to grapple with some strange feeling stirring within her core.

“Uh… Thanks, Bella.” Sid spoke out, finally breaking through the heavy silence that had filled the room. Isabelle was struggling to keep eye contact now, her black, sunken orbs instead dropping their gaze further down, stopping at the other girl’s lips. Even in her unlife, Sid’s lips had remained plush and full, with their perfectly applied black lipstick shining just a little in the dim lighting of the room. She’d only seen a smile on these lips a couple of times before, and tonight was the first time she’d seen one so genuine spread across them.

Isabelle’s own lips weren’t nearly as much to look at. They weren’t necessarily repulsive, but they were far from pretty. Thin, chapped and the same gray tone as her skin. They seemed only just able to cover the set of monstrous, razor teeth behind them, with the occasional glint managing to shine through. But in spite of their cadaverous appearance, these lips were full of life —  so expressive and unafraid to show whatever Bella was feeling in a given moment. So often stretched into a beaming smile when she was happy, or scrunched into a dorky pout when she was annoyed. Even now, Sid could watch as the girl’s bottom lip gently quivered in front of her. Was that nerve, or excitement? It could very well be both.

The mood in the room had shifted astonishingly quickly. Sid wasn’t sure quite how they’d gotten here, or just where all of this tension had come from, but it was truly unavoidable now. She’d been in this situation before, enough to know exactly where it was heading… Was she really going to? With her, of all people? Sid briefly had to ponder over the life choices that had led her to this exact moment.

“…Oh, fuck it. Come here, Bella.” She muttered, unable to stand another second of this tenseness. She gestured Bella in closer, but when the Nosferatu remained uselessly frozen in place, Sid took the liberty of grabbing her by the shirt and yanking her in. The first few seconds of the kiss were rather rough, their lips mashing together in a desperate attempt for a release of that almost painful build up. But once that wave of relief had come, she was able to slow herself down, her eyelids fluttering closed as she settled into a surprisingly delicate show of affection.

Bella was hardly able to comprehend the moment, her arms hanging dumbly at her sides as she all but went limp. But while her body may have been still, her mind was racing with thoughts and feelings that came faster than she could even hope to process — and even though they were both long dead, the Nosferatu could swear that she could feel her own heartbeat pounding away in her chest.

This would continue on for some time, until they’d both finally had their fill of reckless passion. Sid would eventually begin to slowly pull the girl off of her, leaning to hold their lips together for a short moment longer before finally allowing them to part. The Malkavian’s eyes opened once again, offering up a smoky glare that bored deep into the girl who’s face still hung just inches away from her own.

Bella was managing to hang on still. Just about, at least. It took a few moments of sitting there with a foolish, slack-jawed look on her face to finally come to. She shook herself out of the daze, her eyes finally refocusing, and allowing the blurry white shape in front of her to form back in to Sid.

“...Sid, I think I’m gonna faint.”

...

“Vampires can’t faint, idiot.”


<b>Chapter 3</b>

It took a little while, but Sid had finally managed to clear her head and start processing what had just happened. Bella wasn’t quite there yet, continuing to do little aside from awkwardly lean her weight on to Sid and occasionally giggle to herself.

“Can’t believe I just necked a nozzie...” Sid muttered to herself, before rolling her eyes and giving Bella a light pat on the head to get her attention. “Come on, Bella. It wasn’t that big a deal. You don’t have to go in to a coma over it.”

Bella’s only response to this was to bring herself in closer, resting her head on Sid’s shoulder and clinging tightly to her torso.

“...You’re an idiot, Bella.” Sid muttered again, letting out a long sigh as she conceded to the other girl. With a long exhale, she shifted back against the headboard, making herself comfortable as the awkward embrace continued. It seemed there was no point trying to communicate with her right now. But she may as well keep trying, even if for no other reason than to keep the room from falling into total silence again.

“Don’t know about you, but that was my first time kissing another girl.” She spoke, looking down at the Nosferatu still clinging to her like a baby possum. Sid wasn’t sure whether this was endearing, pitiful or both. “Oh, who am I kidding. You’ve never kissed anyone before, have you?”

The Malkavian kept her hand resting atop Isabelle’s head, lightly playing around with her messy grayish-mauve hair. “...Are you just gonna go quiet for the rest of the night, or what?”

“...No.” Bella finally squeaked out a reply, finally breaking her silence. “I just don’t know what to say.”

Sid rolled her eyes and looked down at her once again, “Bella, it was just a kiss. It’s not like we-… Nevermind.” She definitely didn’t need to give Bella any ideas — or herself, for that matter.

“I know!” Bella exclaimed, suddenly becoming animated once again. She jolted up a little, bringing herself to eye level with the other girl, while still loosely holding on to her. “But it’s a kiss with you! And you’re soooo pretty, and you’re so cool, and you’re-… I think I really like you, Sid.” The Nosferatu had bounced back pretty quickly from being totally non-verbal to excitedly gushing over her, leaving Sid a little dazed, who simply took a moment to stare back at her, her eyebrow cocked slightly. But, as pitiful as this display was… It was oddly adorable. Maybe Sid could have some fun with it, after all.

Sid’s confused expression would slowly shift, ending up as a smug smirk as she spoke back to Isabelle. “You’ve got absolutely no clue what you’re doing, do you?” She teased, lifting her hand up to brush some of Bella’s hair aside. This touch alone was enough to cause the Nosferatu to visibly shiver.

“...N...no…” Bella admitted defeat near-instantly as she leaned needily in to Sid’s hand. Sid gently cupped her cheek, while using her other arm to bring her closer. Bella was now practically sitting on Sid’s lap — and, due to their notable size difference, barely fitting on it. Despite the slightly awkward positioning needed to hold a girl that was as freakishly tall as her, the Malkavian made it work.

Sid lightly caressed the Nosferatu’s skin, noting that it wasn’t quite as bad as she’d been expecting. Despite all of the unsightly wilting and scarring, it had retained a certain softness that made it at least somewhat pleasant to the touch. Every single movement of her fingers seemed to draw a reaction from Bella, making her shake and shiver like an excited pet. Sid had seen people obsess over her before, people so desperate for her attention that it almost disgusted her. But this was different. There wasn’t a hint of anything predator or selfish within her — no putting up a front to gain her favour, no ulterior motives behind her words or actions. Isabelle didn’t hesitate at all to leave all of her emotions on display, even if it meant making a fool of herself, and now that she was being given the attention and affection she so desired, she was being nothing but grateful. Sid was very rarely the generous type, but there was a creeping temptation within her to give Bella the reward that she deserved.

“Say, Bella…” Sid began, her tone charged with a seductive, teasing cockiness that she knew would get this loser riled up like nothing else. “You don’t wanna… Fool around some, do you?”

The words made Isabelle’s ears visibly perk up, and Sid would feel the girl’s whole body nervously tense up as she processed the words.

“F.. Fool around? You mean, like-”

“Obviously, Bella. What else am I gonna mean?”

Bella went quiet for a moment, suddenly losing her ability to keep eye contact with Sid for more than a second at a time. She was trying to push the words out, but every time her lips parted to speak, nothing more than a short breath came from them.

“C’mon, spit it out.” Sid encouraged, raising her eyebrow a little, “You are gay, right?”

Urged along by Sid’s words, Bella mustered up a pathetically timid squeak, “...I’ve.. never done it before.”

The response took Sid off guard. It was no surprise at all that Bella was a virgin, but it was more surprising that she somehow felt it necessary to specify in the first place. “...Yeah. I know.” She stated, wondering if there was anything extra Bella had to add.

“...Can we go slow?”

Sid failed to hold back the immediate giggle of amusement that struck her, letting it slip past her lips as she raised a hand to cover her mouth. “You’re like a lost kitten, Bella... Yes, we can go slow.” Sid almost had to commend Isabelle — she was so terrible at this, that it somehow looped back around to being oddly charming. She moved her hand up to give the Nosferatu a reassuring pat on the head to go along with her words.

Bella felt a little embarrassed from the laughing, and even though there was no blood in her to make her turn pink, she felt a phantom heat rising to the surface of her cheeks and the tips of her ears regardless. But she knew Sid wasn’t trying to be mean, and in fact, this is probably the nicest Sid had ever been to her. Her lips curved up into a smile once again, Sid’s treatment of her giving her just enough courage to keep going. “..So.. Wh..What should we do first..?”



“Hmm. Good question.” Sid admitted, taking a moment to think to herself. What was a good way to start? As fun as it sounded to force her right in to the deep end, Sid worried she might actually fry the poor girl’s brain with that. And besides, Bella may be a total dyke, but Sid had never really found herself attracted to any girls before, and thus was a little out of her element here. It was probably in her own interests that they didn’t rush things too much. “...Okay, how about this?”

Sid scooted up a little, freeing up some space between her and Isabelle. She took her hands off of the Nosferatu and brought them back towards herself, grabbing onto the fabric of her crop top. Shimmying her arms for a moment, she brought them through the armholes, making sure to keep a close eye on Bella’s face as she lifted the garment up over her head, and giving her full view of what was underneath. It seemed that even with her bra still in the way, it was enough to leave Bella totally stunned. The poor girl’s eyes kept darting off to the side, as though unsure if she was even allowed to look. Her bony fingers nervously fidgeted with each other, she was totally unable to sit still, and the only sound to come from her was an awkward, stunted chuckle. Sid held back a grin, reaching up to cup Bella’s chin and bring her vision on to her chest, a non-verbal confirmation that she was allowed to ogle all she liked.

“You wanna see more than just this, don’t you?” Sid asked her, waiting for Bella’s response, which came in the form of a weak little nod. “Then help me get this off. Can’t have you just sitting there with that dumb look on your face the whole time.”

Sid helped Bella get started, gently taking hold of both her hands and bringing them around to her back. She could feel Isabelle’s hands shaking as she found where the bra’s straps connected, struggling to release the hooks for a few moments, before she finally felt the tension in the elastic release. Isabelle took a few more moments still, not letting go of the fabric until Sid had given her a look that told her to go ahead. Once her fingers finally released it, the bra fell an inch or so away from the Malkavian’s chest. It wasn’t quite enough to reveal everything in full yet, giving Sid the satisfaction of being able to tease Bella those few extra seconds as she let the straps slide down her arms. She didn’t make her wait too long, allowing the cups of the bra to slide down enough to finally show what was underneath.

Sid’s breasts weren’t the biggest in the world, but they were of respectable size and well-suited to her petite form. Like the rest of her body, they were perfectly smooth and almost paper-white in colour, retaining a slight pink hue in the area surrounding her stiff, perky nipples. Poor Isabelle was trying her best to appreciate them, but her head was spinning with nerves and excitement that were making her feel somewhat nauseous. “They’re… Th-They’re, uh…” Bella stammered, trying to find the right words in that scrambled brain of hers.

As cute as it was to watch Bella stutter and stumble over her words, if she waited for her to finish speaking every time she opened her mouth, the sun would be rising before they’d even got to have any real fun. With a roll of her eyes, Sid took Bella by the wrists, guiding her hands to place them firmly on her breasts. Bella tensed for a moment, before a visible shiver of excitement travelled across the entire length of her body. “Why don’t you just show me what you think, Bella?” Sid suggested, releasing the girl’s wrists and letting her run free.

Guys were always so rough with her tits, squeezing and rubbing at them as though they were mere objects, not even attached to a person. Not that Sid wasn’t capable of taking it, or was even entirely opposed to it, but it seemed like men were just incapable of learning the merits of a more careful touch every now and then. Bella, it seemed, didn’t have this problem. The way her fingers caressed her chest was tender and careful, so gently kneading her fingers against the soft, sensitive flesh in a way that Sid hadn’t gotten to experience before. There was clear curiosity in her touch, ensuring that not a single centimetre was left unexplored, but she made sure never to push, pinch or squeeze her too roughly. Even though the complete lack of experience was clear, all that soft massaging was starting to become surprisingly effective. Sid’s breath hitched a little and a few areas of her body tensed, before she allowed herself to relax fully against the headboard. Bella seemed happy to continue like this, becoming more confident in her movements, and in no rush to stop. After her own curiosities had been satisfied, the Nosferatu seemed to shift focus a little — she experimented with giving more attention to certain spots, such as gently circling her thumbs over Sid’s nipples, and attempting to gauge her reaction. Despite this being her first time, and her practically having been given full reign, she seemed more focus on trying to make it feel good for Sid than she was on herself. Not only that, but against all odds, it was actually starting to work.

Sid let out a low mewl of pleasure, unable to stop the sound before it slipped out. She hadn’t even noticed it until now, but she’d started gently pushing her thighs together, subconsciously grinding them against each other with excitement. She returned her focus to the Nosferatu, who was staring her down with a huge, toothy grin on her face. “..A..Alright, no need to look so smug, Bella.”

Bella’s expression quickly changed to one of confusion upon hearing that. “..Smug? Wh-.. No, no!” She exclaimed, genuine surprise in her tone. “That’s not what I-, it’s just-… A-Am I doing a good job..?”

Sid blinked a few times at her, briefly looking her up and down. Another little snicker broke through her expression, before she gave a little sigh and admitted, “Yes, you’re doing good. Keep it up, and maybe I’ll let you kiss me again.”

Having given that little encouragement, the Malkavian relaxed back fully once again and let Bella get back to work. She lifted her arms up behind her head and closed her eyes, deciding to enjoy the free massage to its fullest. Soon enough, Isabelle’s hands began to drift from her chest and slowly start exploring elsewhere. She brought her hands down gently across Sid’s sides, taking the time to appreciate and enjoy every inch of that smooth, pale skin. She gently reached around to massage along her back, and briefly up along her arms. Slowly but surely, Sid found herself relaxing in a way that didn’t come to her very often. The same kind of relaxed sensation that her muscles usually only experienced for a brief few seconds before she entered her daily sleep. It continued on for a while, before something would stir her back in to focus again — a soft sensation, pecking lightly against her chest. The girl opened one eye to take a look, and was met with the sight of Bella, slightly hunched over, and ever-so-gently pressing her lips to Sid’s chest.

“B-Bella!” Sid blurted out, clearly taken by surprise. Bella tensed up and froze in place, lips still cupped lightly over one of her nipples. After a moment, she pulled back slightly, with the same wide-eyed, unsure expression you’d see from a dog that’s just been caught doing something bad.

“I-Is this too far..?” Bella asked, the worry clear in her voice along with the complete lack of assertiveness. She didn’t want to do anything that had made Sid uncomfortable, especially not without having asked if it was okay first.

Sid looked down at her for a few moments, taking in the look on her face. Bella could look so pathetic sometimes, but it was becoming so strangely adorable. Like a sopping wet puppy left out in the rain. Sid couldn’t help but feel bad for her. “It’s fine, Bella.” She stated, lightly petting her hair for a moment with another sigh. “I just wasn’t expecting it… Do whatever you want, I don’t care.”




The sensation of Sid’s hand gently caressing the top of her head immediately seemed to relax the anxious Nosferatu, and it brought a dumb, satisfied little giggle from past her lips. Slowly, she’d begin to crane her neck forward until her lips touched against Sid’s torso once more. Sid continued to run her fingers through the other girl’s hair as the feeling of Bella’s soft tongue dragging lightly over her nipple caused her to give up a light, but noticeable shiver of pleasure. This caused a second, more energetic giggle to come from Bella, and encouraged her to start trying even harder. Once again her lack of experience was clear, and instead of moving with any semblance of grace, her mouth couldn’t do much better than awkwardly and clumsily kissing, licking and occasionally suckling at various spots across both of her breasts. But once again, the lack of experience hardly even seemed to matter. The amount of care Bella put in to every touch and caress of her thin lips, and the way she showed absolute dedication to trying her best despite having no idea what she was doing, was somehow making every moment of this so much more enjoyable.

Sid was still relaxed, but she could no longer sit still. Every few moments she had to shift around on the spot, arching her back out or grinding one of her thighs against the other. Kindred had no need to breathe, and yet the tensing and relaxing of her body pushed heavier and heavier breaths through her nostrils as Isabelle’s attempts only grew more involved. She felt that tongue travel up along to her collarbone, and even exploring around the especially sensitive skin of her neck, before moving back down to start from the beginning. She was either a quick learner or something of a natural, and it was really starting to show.

Her fingers gripped a little tighter on to Isabelle’s hair, clutching her head closer to her chest, and encouraging her to start getting a little rougher. The Nosferatu seemed hesitant, but soon began testing the waters. She lapped her tongue energetically over the skin, leaving cold trails of saliva wherever it travelled. She started to suckle harder, leaving subtle, but visible marks that trailed across the surface of her chest. Bella even began to gently nip at her with her teeth every now and then, though she made sure to be extra careful with her. She knew from experience that her teeth were sharp. They were practically deadly weapons, but when used with such delicacy, they were able to leave no more than pleasant pinches and pricks, every one of which caused Sid to release anything from a soft, satisfied grunt to a sharp gasp of pleasure.

There was a stirring sensation in her body, a rising heat between her thighs that she hadn’t experienced in some time now, and along with it, growing damp patch that soaked through on to her legs. Eventually, her body forced her to speak up, honestly admitting the effect Isabelle was having on her with with a simple, yet heavily charged statement.

“F..Fucking hell, Bella..”


<b>Chapter 4</b>

”J-Just… Let me know if I’m going too rough…” Bella nervously muttered, her soft tone contrasting heavily with the way she ravenously tasted and bit on the other girl’s skin. In all the excitement, she’d accidentally pricked her with those sharp teeth a few times, causing a spew of apologies until Sid had told her to shut up and keep going. Bella obliged, reluctantly at first, but it didn’t take too long for her desires to start dulling her inhibitions once more. Sid watched the Nosferatu, just barely able to stop herself from going completely feral over her body. It was partially amusing, and heavily tantalizing.
However, despite her excitement, Isabelle still needed to be led along somewhat. She apparently still hadn’t conceived of the idea of moving her focus to any other part of Sid’s body, and as admittedly enjoyable as this was, the Malkavian needed more. The hand that was still half-petting, half-pulling on Bella’s hair instead moved down to grab at one of her bony wrists. She guided it down along her smooth, pale form, making Isabelle scratch lightly at her skin with her pink-painted fingernails. The hand travelled further and further down, finally coming to rest on her inner thigh. Sid firmly pushed her hand down, making it extra clear what she wanted from the other girl next. Bella had no objections, and as soon as Sid released her wrist she began to curiously explore without any of the same hesitation she’d had prior. Her hand squeezed and rubbed at the plush, soft thigh in a way that was eager, but remained gentle, snaking her fingers between Sid’s legs to rub at her inner thighs, just below the radiating heat of her arousal.
“I don’t know what’s gotten in to you, Bella…” Sid muttered through gritted teeth and pleasured grunts, bringing the Nosferatu’s head in close to her own to speak in a harsh, breathy tone right in to her ear, “...But you better not fucking stop.”
Hearing that demanding whisper as Sid clutched so tightly on to her caused Isabelle to shake with excitement, with the only response she could muster being a needy little whimper of agreement. Bella shifted her head slightly, allowing her to start leaving a trail of hungry kisses from Sid’s cheek down to her neck, the desperation with which she did so showing just how bad her desire to show her affection was getting. Her hand moved up underneath Sid’s black skirt, lingering for just a moment, before testing the waters by gently grazing her fingers over the soaked fabric of her underwear. Feeling just how damp it was down there brought another wave of vibrant titillation to the Nosferatu, which she expressed in the first manner that came to her scrambled mind — biting down on Sid’s shoulder. She didn’t do so with too much force, but it was hard enough to bring a sharp gasp from the Malkavian. For a brief moment, Bella worried once more that she’d gone too far. However, as she watched the girl beneath her shiver with excitement, and felt her jamming her legs together and trapping Bella’s hand in between, her nerves lifted some, as she relaxed her jaws and followed up with a sprinkling of soft kisses along the visible teeth marks.
As the tension in Sid’s upper legs finally released and let Isabelle’s hand free, she’d finally begin giving the girl the release she’d been waiting for. She pressed her fingers firmly against the wettest spot of fabric and began to work them up and down. It started at a slow, slightly unsure pace, but as soon as she received positive feedback from Sid in the form of gentle whines of pleasure, her movements quickly began to pick up speed. Every time one of those sweet sounds slipped from the Malkavian, Bella was spurred to work harder and harder in hopes of hearing more and more of them.
Sid felt the pleasure rising within her surprisingly quickly, far quicker than she was used to. She put her arms around the other girl, grabbing a handful of fabric from the back of her shirt and clutching on to it tightly, as her other hand forced her head down towards herself, as though urging her to put that surprisingly skilled mouth to use once again. Bella didn’t need any more of an excuse than that, immediately beginning to greedily lick and kiss her once more. Her tongue dragged itself over the same places it had before — her nipples, collarbone and neck — but soon Bella’s curiosity began to take her elsewhere, wanting to taste more of her. Her tongue happily explored the nearby skin that hadn’t already been coated in her saliva, making even more of a mess of Sid in the process. With no clear direction in mind, she trailed over to her shoulder, and then along her upper arm, before finally ending up just underneath it. With a little nudge of her head, she was able to get Sid to lift her arm just enough to allow Bella to plant a soft kiss on her armpit.
Even in the throes of passion and pleasure, this caught Sid’s attention pretty fast, and only threw her off even more when the Nosferatu began to focus all of her attention on the area. Her tongue lapped away at her underarm with increased excitement, causing Sid a slew of mixed feelings that she didn’t have the mental capacity spare to sort through in this moment — not with her climax creeping closer with every second. She reached up to tightly grab a handful of Bella’s hair, but her body found itself unable to decide whether to pull her away from the spot or push her further in.
“B..Bella.. What the fuck are you- AH!” Sid’s questioning was countered before she could even get it out by an increased rubbing at her desperate, swollen crotch. The fabric of her underwear had gotten so soaked now that Bella’s fingers could glide over them as if they weren’t there in the first place, leading to a deceptively intense sensation for having no direct contact. The Malkavian was almost embarrassed that she was this far along to an orgasm without even getting her knickers off, not to mention the fact that they were going to be totally ruined after this. All of that, along with the fact that Sid seemed unable to stop Bella from practically making out with her armpit, gave her the realisation that she’d rather quickly lost her control over this situation entirely. This inexperienced, virgin nozzie was asserting full dominance over her — and what’s worse, she was doing it without even meaning to. Isabelle was driven almost purely by a desire to please Sid, and she was managing to do so much better than could have been expected. As for the fixation on her axilla, that seemed to be her indulging in some of her own curiosities while she had the chance.
Eventually, Sid was forced to admit defeat, her body starting to tense and tremble as Bella’s clumsy-yet-effective fingers brought her closer and closer to her peak. Her body was too impatient to wait much longer, roughly grinding her hips against Isabelle’s fingers in an attempt to speed up the process. Lucky for her, the Nosferatu had no desire to tease or withhold the orgasm from her, and seeming to pick up on the increased urgency in her body language, she’d push her fingers firmly into the wet fabric and begin to rub at her as feverishly as she could manage. The pleasure radiated across her whole body, causing every movement and shift in position to send tingles running throughout her —  even the soft, ticklish sensation of Bella’s tongue against her armpit became notably stimulating. An unbroken stream of huffs, whines and moans spilled from Sid’s open mouth, her back arching and her clutches on the other girl tightening until finally, she felt herself go over the edge.


“Fuck, Bella!” She gasped, shoving her hips roughly up against Isabelle’s fingers and bringing her into a close embrace. The Nosferatu’s head was jammed underneath Sid’s arm, causing a shiver to run through her that almost rivalled the Malkavian’s intense trembling. As Sid rode out the waves of ecstatic sensation her body rhythmically tensed and relaxed, and any thoughts that had been running through her head previously were forced to take a backseat to pure desire and satisfaction Isabelle had sparked up in her. This didn’t cease until her climax finally began to die down, slowly ramping down until it had become a light electric buzz that still gently coursed through her, allowing her access to her mental faculties once again.
As she huffed and panted — not out of any real need to catch her breath, but simply out of an old habit from her days as a mortal — it took her several more moments to finally find her voice again, her grip on the other girl slowly loosening as she looked down to her and spoke.
“..R..Really, Bella? My armpit?” She addressed her with clear judgement. Isabelle, who had been much too focused to say much of anything until now, offered a nervous giggle that seemed to imply shame, though the dumb grin on her face showed much the opposite.
“Sorry! I just-”
“It’s fine, Bella. Nevermind.” Sid interrupted tersely and swiftly, realising that every moment spent dwelling on this was a moment she’d have to consider just how much she’d enjoyed that perverse little act.
Isabelle slowly withdrew her hand from the loose grip Sid’s thighs still had on it, her fingers still damp with Sid’s gliss. Unable to help herself, Bella lifted the hand up towards her face and curiously tested it with her tongue — enough to draw an exasperated sigh from Sid as she watched it happen.
“Gross, Bella.”

<b>Chapter 5</b>

By now Sid had mostly managed to put herself back together, as she sat with her back against the headboard and held Bella in her arms. This affection had been mostly forced upon her, with Bella insistent on cuddling up to her, leaving the Malkavian with no comfortable position to rest her arms aside from leaving them wrapped around the other girl. But she did have to admit, it wasn’t an entirely unpleasant experience. Isabelle had latched on to Sid with her face nestled against her pale neck, occasionally planting a gentle kiss upon it and quietly giggling to herself. Meanwhile, Sid would somewhat awkwardly pat at her back in response, while fiddling around with the tangles in Isabelle’s hair.
She was having a hard time figuring out how exactly she felt about this whole situation. For one, she wasn’t even convinced that she liked girls. She’d never considered it in any serious manner up until this point, and was relatively convinced that she was entirely straight. But straight girls don’t usually let their female friends fingerfuck them, and they especially don’t end up having one of the most intense climaxes of their lives from it.
Secondly, Bella was… Weird. They shared a few interests here and there, but in many regards, the two were complete opposites. Bella was loud, annoying, and mostly incompetent — but she had an odd charm, in her own special way. It was strangely relaxing to be around her, seeing her going about without a care in the world, just happy to be there. She envied that optimism in a way, and how she’d managed to hold on to the spark that Sid had seemed to lose some time ago. But sometimes when she was around her, she was almost able to pretend like she still had it, even if only for a few moments.
Sid caught herself in the middle of the thought, shaking herself out of the daze and bringing her focus back to reality. ‘Great, now I’m getting all sappy, too.’, she thought to herself. There was so much to unpack here, things that Sid would rather save thinking about until later. Or better yet, avoid thinking about them entirely. She took a glance down at Isabelle, who was still snuggled up to her in a somewhat awkward pose — this position wasn’t exactly well-suited to their difference in height. But Bella didn’t seem to mind, nor was she experiencing any of the same internal conflicts Sid was going through. In fact, Isabelle looked to be on cloud nine, absolutely ecstatic about tonight’s events, and happily relaxing in the aftermath.
Sid decided to try taking a page out of her book. She leaned her head back and attempted to relax the tenseness in her body, gently running her hand up and down along Bella’s back as she let out a sigh. The mattress they were sat on was actually fairly comfortable, at least compared to the ones Sid was used to, and while Isabelle was bony and jagged all over, her slim form was at least easy to hold on to. The soaking wet panties she still had on were a bit of an annoyance, but aside from that, she found herself relatively cosy.
It was hard to keep track of how long they had been sat in silence for, but after some unknown amount of time, Bella’s voice would finally perk up once again.
“Siiiiiid?” She chirped, her tone conveying some kind of bashful curiosity over something.
Sid responded with a simple “Yes?”, looking down towards Isabelle as she withdrew her face from her neck.
“You know how I, like… Did all of that stuff to you just now?”
Sid already has a suspicion of where this was going, but she allowed Bella to keep talking regardless, “Yes, Bella… What about it?”
“D… Do you think you could maybe… Do it back?”
The Malkavian went quiet, glancing off to the side and then back at her again as she tried to think about it.
“I-If you don’t want to, that’s fine!” Bella began to stutter, that complete lack of assertiveness showing itself once again. Even just working up the courage to ask her had taken her this long. “It just.. Looked really fun.. And, uh.. I.. I dunno…” She began to trail off, falling into a nervous silence once again.
Letting Bella do that to her was one thing, but doing it back to her was different. Beforehand, she’d had to do nothing more than lay there and order her around a little. Taking the active role in the situation felt a lot more — for lack of a better word — gay. It’s not like there was zero temptation to go along with it, but it felt like a pretty big step up that made Sid unsure and hesitant. She stared down at Isabelle, silently examining the look on her face for a few moments. She was giving her those stupid puppy dog eyes again, and it was starting to have an effect on her. The first thought to cross her mind was ‘She’s so pathetic.’, followed shortly by ‘She’s so cute.’.
Sid let out a long sigh, leaning her head back and staring up at the ceiling for a moment, before finally giving Bella the answer she was so hopeful to hear. “Fiiiine. Might as well.”
Bella could hardly contain her excitement at this, immediately jolting up with a huge grin on her face. Sid kept whatever enthusiasm she had hidden away, slowly shifting forward on the bed to bring herself closer to Bella again. Isabelle’s excitement remained clear, although the nerves would clearly start to creep in once more as she asked, “..So, uh… How should we… Yknow..?”
Sid glanced her up and down, thinking for a moment. Bella was sat on her knees with her hands on her lap, giving off the energy of a dog just barely able to stay patient when waiting for a treat. After she’d thought about it, Sid shifted around once again to assume what seemed like a fairly convenient position. She sat behind Bella and leaned in gently against her back, wrapping her left arm loosely around her torso.
“This work for you?” Sid asked, trying not to sound too unsure herself. 
Bella could barely contain her excitement now, staring straight ahead and just barely managing to squeak out an “Uh huh.”
“Do you wanna… Take your shorts off first?”
“Oh, uh, right!” Bella reached her shaky hands down to her waist, beginning to fumble with the button and the zip on her black denim shorts. There was a good deal of hesitation from her, before she was urged along by a light tapping from Sid’s hand. She hooked her thumbs into the waistband, awkwardly beginning to shuffle the clothing down along her legs, leaving them just past her knees. Bella had every right to be embarrassed about taking them off, as Sid raised an eyebrow and let out something between a laugh and a scoff as she looked down at what was underneath.
“Bella… Are you fucking five?” She spoke through the condescending chuckling, staring at the Sonic the Hedgehog boxer-briefs Bella was wearing.
Isabelle felt her whole body flush with heat as she tried to protest the teasing, “S-Siiiid, shut up!” She whined, “I just..- shut up!” She was unable to come up with much in the way of a defence, instead simply repeating her complaints.
“Okay, okay…” Sid said, slowly beginning to stifle her laughter. She couldn’t help but ask, though, “...But why boxers?”
“..They’re cozy.” Bella spoke meekly, having hunched over a little in embarrassment. Sid couldn’t help but feel a little bad for her once again, placing her chin on the Nosferatu’s shoulder and giving her another reassuring pat.
“I guess it’s kinda cute… In a really lame kind of way.” Sid teased, giving one last smirk before trying to focus once again. She placed her free hand on Bella’s thigh, just at the bottom of those silly boxers. Even with that slight morale boost, as they got closer to the actual event, Sid found some uncertainty coming back to her. “So, uh… You ready?” She asked, trying to keep her tone nonchalant and unbothered. It’s not that big a deal, anyway, right? Just rubbing at her for a while, maybe saying some naughty things to help her along, simple. Once Bella had given her another nod, Sid began to shift her hand to her inner thigh, closer and closer to her crotch, as the other girl bit her lip lightly in anticipation.
The first touch wasn’t very skilful, nor were the ones to come after it. In fact, Sid didn’t seem to be very good at this — or at least, she wasn’t putting any enthusiasm in to it. She awkwardly rubbed two fingers across the fabric of Bella’s boxers, right over her quickly dampening slit. The movements were robotic and uncertain, despite Sid’s best attempts to get in to it. Even though she had touched herself as many times as you’d expect a woman of her age to have, doing it to someone else was somehow entirely different.
However, you would’ve had no idea that Sid was doing a terrible job based on Bella’s reaction. The moment Sid’s fingers had touched against her she’d let out a high-pitched whimper, and from that point on, the girl had immediately started letting a constant stream of moans and whines slip from her. Sid was taken aback by just how quickly she’d started to have an effect on the girl — and it’s not like she was faking it or exaggerating, either. That much was clear from just how little time it took for her to soak right through her Sonic boxers.
“Huh… So, you really like this?” Sid observed, her tone being mostly neutral, but allowing a hint of curiosity to slip through. She continued her two-fingered rubbing up and down along the same spot, slowly speeding up, but still not doing much of interest. She watched Isabelle shaking and lightly bucking her hips forward, huffing and panting right next to Sid’s ear. One of the Nosferatu’s hands scrambled around for a few moments, trying to find where Sid’s other hand had gotten to. Once she’d found it, she would take hold of it, giving it a gentle squeeze as she brought it up to her lips to half-kiss it, half-use it to cover her lips in an attempt to stifle some of her moans.
She thought she’d been a mess when Bella was doing this to her, but the comparison between both of their reactions was night and day. Well, at least Sid could see that this would be easier than she’d thought.
Bella was squeezing tighter on to Sid’s hand now, planting needy little kisses all across the back of her palm as the whimpers and whines continued to flow. Her whole body was shaking now, as she leaned her weight against the Malkavian and allowed herself to give in to tantalizing sensation. She began bucking her hips wildly against Sid’s hand, forcing her to push her fingers more firmly against her. Just as had happened to Sid, Bella’s underwear had become so slick with her own juices that there was little resistance against her skin. Isabelle gasped, moaned and whispered incoherent words of praise to Sid as her entire body tensed up. Watching every second of this as it happened, Sid was beginning to feel something click together in her brain. Being able to see the massive effect she had on the girl as became the first person ever to touch her like this, it was… Exciting.
“Fuck, Bella, you’re-” Sid began to speak in a sultry tone, before interrupted by a dawning realisation, “Wait… Did you cum already?”
Bella’s moans were still continuing, but she’d quickly began to lose steam, replaced mostly by a stream of sharp gasps and heavy exhales. Her body was mostly limp as she rested back against Sid, and the girl was looking up at nothing in particular with a dreamy expression as she just about managed to push out a response. “...Haah… Ahah… Yeah…” She admitted without a hint of shame, any embarrassment that she may have had been drowned out by pure ecstasy. Sid slowly ramped down her rubbing to a halt, leaving her hand resting gently over the soaked fabric. The Malkavian rolled her eyes, finding it typical that Bella would go and do this right as she was starting to enjoy herself. But on the other hand, knowing that even her simple, awkward touches had brought this girl to such an intense climax so quickly… It was kind of adorable.
“Well, I guess it can’t be helped. You are a total virgin after all…” She teased, leaning in close to Bella’s ear to follow her words up with a playful whisper, “Or rather, you were a total virgin.” This comment caused Bella to softly whine and give one last, lazy buck of her hips as the last little remnants of pleasure still swam across her body. Sid wrapped her spare arm around the girl once again, holding her close from behind and keeping her head resting on her shoulder, allowing herself to enjoy the comfort of this position. 
All of this had managed to clear her head up some, and while it may not have been the answer she’d expected or necessarily wanted, one thing had become pretty abundantly obvious: Sid clearly liked girls. Or at the very least, she liked this girl in particular. It was a bit of a shake-up for her, but there were probably far bigger things going on in her life for her to worry about. So whatever, she thought; might as well enjoy it.
“Hey, Bella?” Sid perked up again, remaining in the same position as she spoke.
“..Y..Yeah, Sid?” Bella replied, just about recovered enough from her first time to speak coherently.
“Please tell me you’ve got some underwear that aren’t completely ridiculous. I really don’t wanna have to walk home in a pair of Spongebob undies tomorrow.”
